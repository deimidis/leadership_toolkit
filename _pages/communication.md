## Mozillians Communicate to Extend the Reach of their Stories:

All Mozillians need to effectively communicate their ideas with each other. All ideas come from a specific context and how Mozillians communicate to clarify a context can promote innovation, develop networks and build communities. The stories that we tell each other and the way that way communicate with other can deeply impact presentations, new audiences and our relationships with other Mozillians.

The key to communicating effectively in order to extend Mozillian reach to developer communities and to introduce open source to the world include:

1. How Mozillians choose to tell their stories
2. How Mozillians choose to curate and organize their content, resources and stories
3. How Mozillians choose to share their stories with others.
