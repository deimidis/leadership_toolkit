## Networking: Mozillians Build an Open Community.

All Mozillians contribute towards a shared open community. Each person is able to build and support the community in different ways. To build an open community Mozillians collaborate in depend on each other. A person’s credibility and reputation is based on their skills, experiences and contributions. An open community is supported by a group of people co-creating and co-owning projects together. The leadership of an open community is shared between those who choose to participate and contribute their skills, abilities and knowledge.
