# Telling your story

## Purpose
When you will give a talk or just have a conversation with other people, and you want to explain an idea, you need to prepare your message. Giving away your message with a clear structure and goal will help you on deliver it and mobilize people to your goal.

## Outcome
* An easy way to plan a talk or conversation to be sure on what you want to communicate
* Create a clear plan to mobilize people to your goal

## Time and Materials
* Time: 30 mins
* Difficulty: Medium
* Materials: Pen and Template

## Detailed Steps

1. Print the template or use a paper and draw it similar to the template.
2. Add the message you want to give in the «Title» area. Explain your main idea in just one sentence. It has to **express your point of view**, your opinion in the matter. So the idea is a phrase like: *Firefox is the best browser to protect your privacy* and not *Firefox and privacy*. And has to be a sentence, not a paragraph. You could use a draft paper to experiment with different ideas and way to say it before adding the final sentence.
3. Identified support ideas or messages that will help to *prove* the thesis. Write many, you will not use all of them, but it will help you to think I you will have to prioritize later. Those will be the heading of your talk. You could write as many as you want in the *support ideas* area of the template.
4. Once you have 3-5 support ideas in the draft, it's time to prioritze them and find will be the 3 main support ideas. Find an order for them. Could be logical, chronological, etc. Write down the chosen one in the template second page.
5. For each of those *headings* write details that will explain the headings. Those will be the main points at each section of the talk.
6. For each *heading* write a bottom line, what is the main message you want your audience understand on that section?
7. A basic structure of each section could be:
   * Give the premise of the section
   * Substantiate or support the premise with examples, stories, statistics, etc.
   * Tie-in the section premise to the speech thesis
   * Transition to the next heading.
8. Now you have the structure of the talk or message. It's time to work in the *beginning/introduction* of the topic (that could be a personal story, a set of questions/statements about current status and ideal world) and the *ending*, which will be your **call to action**, what you will be asking to your audience to do after your talk? It's important to note that this is not a story. Commonly, in short stories the end had a surprise that will change your expectations. This is not what we want in our talk. The end is the space to summarize what we said and ask something to our audience.
